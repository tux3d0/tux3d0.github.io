		<p> 
			Look I'm going to keep it real with you, my name is Joey Jones, you can call me Joe if you like. I don't care either way, just not Joseph,<br />
			 I'm not ready to be that professional yet, I wan't to enjoy my twenties, but at the same time work towards my career and retirement. <br />I am an Eagle Scout from Boy Scout Troop 1770. I am also a dual major in Computer Science and Business Administration. <br /> My career goals are to be a Penetration Tester a.k.a a professional hacker. I have been around the coutnry and soon mnay places. I have lived on the west coast and was born in Michigan.<br /> I am a country boy at heart and a city boy by nature. When I work on a project I give it my all and do not stop until it is finished.
